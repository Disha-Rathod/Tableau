Question 3:
Spotlighting is a technique for showing discrete thresholds based on the values of a measure. You are tasked with creating a table showing total sales by product category, broken down by Year and Month. To complete this task, you will need to create a new calculation titled “Sales Spotlight” that categorizes your total sales into “Good” if total sales are over $10,000, and “Bad” if total sales are lower than $10,000. Furthermore, you will need to create a Region filter, colorize your table by your new Sales Spotlight field, and add Profit to your Tooltip.
